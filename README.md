Astro Sphere is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme based on my personal website.

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components.

## Editorial Workflow

This repo now includes a local content workflow designed for GitHub Pages:

- Create drafts locally with `npm run content -- new ...`
- Manage visibility with `status: draft | published | archived`
- Delete entries locally or through review branches
- Submit content and status changes through pull requests with `npm run content -- submit-review ...`
- Use `/studio` locally for a visual management UI via `npm run studio:dev`

See [`docs/content-workflow.md`](docs/content-workflow.md) for the full workflow.
